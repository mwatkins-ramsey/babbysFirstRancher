To test locally:
- need to create a .env directly inside the .build folder (copy+modify the example-env.env file), and dont commit to repo
- if you are on windows you can use a powershell terminal to cd into the .build folder and then run
>.\cleanbuildcompose.ps1

- if you are on mac/linux you will need to execute the docker commands of that script manually until a comparable .sh is created
